					* With the fast-expanding number of vehicles in smart cities,
					 the management of road intersections and traffic congestion has grown 
					 to be major problems

				* methodologies such as vehicle counting, controlling process, and 
					  evaluation of lanes keeping status in mind, this whole procedure is 
					  implemented by taking the complete traffic network into an account 
					  instead of just considering intersections.

				* We need to assign a plan for traffic flow that has the least amount of 
				  traffic congestion and vehicle waiting time.

				** Alternate Routes 
				
					* Alternate routes play a significant role in traffic management systems by 
					providing drivers with alternative paths to reach their destinations during 
					periods of congestion, road closures, accidents, or other disruptions. 
					
					* The primary goals of using alternate routes in a traffic management system are to:

						* Relieve Congestion

						* Improve Travel Time 

						* Enhance Traffic Flow
						
						* Handle Incidents and Road Closures
						
						* Distribute Traffic Load 
						
						* Emergency Response 

						* Optimize Route Planning

						* Reduce Environmental Impact
						
						* Enhance Driver Experience
