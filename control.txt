          ** Traffic light colors

               *Traffic signs communicate to the driver what to expect on the road ahead. 
               The color of the sign also has meaning and sends a message to the driver. 
               Here are some common traffic sign colors and their meanings:

               1) Red: Red means STOP! A red traffic sign tells the driver to stop. 
                    This limits the driver from going further.

               2) Green: Green means go. A green traffic sign tells the driver they can proceed.

               3) Yellow: A yellow traffic sign stands for caution and serves as a general warning.

               4) Black and White: A black and white traffic sign posts regulations such as speed.

               5) Orange: An orange traffic sign signals construction or road maintenance. 
                       Be prepared to slow down!

               6) Brown: A brown traffic sign indicates local recreation areas or points of interest.

               7) Blue: A blue traffic sign offers information to assist the driver.

          ** Why Is Traffic Control Important for Cities?

                    * Increased Accidents
                         The more vehicles that there are on a roadway, the more accidents there are going to
               be. In fact, in many urban areas, traffic-related auto accidents are a leading cause
               of death. Of course, mortality is the primary concern of traffic-related accidents; 
               however, collisions in which drivers and passengers do not sustain injuries are problematic, 
               as well. Even minor fender benders can cause thousands of dollars in damages.

                    * Air Pollution
                         Accidents aren't the only problem associated with traffic congestion as pollution
                         is a significant concern, too. More cars, buses, trucks, SUVs, motorcycles, and other
                         vehicles create harmful emissions that can hurt the environment. As more VOCs are emitted 
               into the atmosphere, the quality of the air is impacted. Traffic-related pollution 
               contributes to an influx of health problems. In some urban areas, the pollution levels are 
               so high that you can quite literally see a blanket of smog enveloping the city.

                    * Reduced Emergency Assistance
                         When roadways are congested, emergency vehicles are unable to make their way through.
                         In the event of an emergency, motorists struggle to pull over to allow ambulances,
                         patrol cars, and other vital response vehicles to pass through, further worsening the gridlock.
               And of course, emergency care is delayed, which could ultimately put lives in danger.

                    * Reduced Productivity
               A high volume of vehicles on urban roadways significantly reduces the richness of the city. 
               Employees are late to work, deliveries are delayed, and appointments are canceled. Businesses 
               in high-traffic cities can suffer significant consequences.

          * Interventions to reduce traffic congestion

                    1. Optimise traffic-light management
                    2. Use CCTV to monitor road conditions
                    3. Charge for workplace parking
                    4. Improve perceptions of buses
                    5. Use Inbound Flow Control
                    6. Improve cycling infrastructure


               * The one-hit solution

                         1. Widen roads / Narrow roads
                         2. Add bus lanes / Remove bus lanes
                         3. Build tunnels
                         4. Build a light rail network
                         5. Ban cycling / Ban cars from city centres
                         6. Introduce a congestion charge/road pricing
                         7. Build more car parks

          ** Traffic Rules in India

               * Keep to your left if driving on a two-way street or road so that vehicles coming in the opposite 
                 direction can pass using the right lane smoothly.

               * If you want to turn left ahead, you must stay on the left side before taking a turn.

               * If you want to turn right ahead, you must be at the centre of the road and then gradually 
                 take a broad right turn.

               * When you are coming towards a road intersection, road junction, or pedestrian crossing, 
                 you must slow down your vehicle.

               * Overtaking is prohibited in the following cases:

                    - If passing is near a bend, hill, corner, or point, as it may lead to a critical accident 
                      without clear sight of the road in front.
                    - If the driver upfront has not signalled the driver behind.
